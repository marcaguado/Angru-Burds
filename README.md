# Angru Burds

This is an Angry Birds clone made with C++, Qt, and Box2D for the Object Oriented Programming with C++. This was part of a group project.

As a summary of my contributions, I worked on the level loader, created the levels, the menu and its functionality, testing, bugfixing, the UI, and did part of the graphics/textures.
