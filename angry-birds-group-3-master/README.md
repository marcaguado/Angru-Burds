This Angry-Birds mock-up game is a group project done for course "Object oriented programming with C++" in Aalto University.

The player shoots birds towards the enemy pigs that are placed in fortresses made of destroyable and un-destroyable game objects. Player should use as few birds as possible for a higher score. The game is won, if all the pigs are destroyed before the player runs out of birds. There are three levels with increasing difficulty that the player can choose from. 

**For a detailed description of the game and build instructions, please see project documentation in /doc folder.**
